# Galaktec Digital TS CPU

This package breaks out the CPU from the Galaktec Digital project. This one is aiming to implement the CPU emulation
in Typescript. There is another repo galaktec-digital-cpu that is a similar concept but started in Rust.

For the time being this may become the active project, leaving the Rust project behind temporarily till more of the
infrastructure is fleshed out.
